Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

In this project, we are asked to predict the number of units of products that will be sold in different stores of a large grocery chain in Ecuador called Corporaci√≥n Favorita.
This is a time series forecasting problem. That means you're using past sales data (with dates) to predict future sales.

Your goal:

Use machine learning to build a model that can accurately forecast sales of thousands of products across various stores, for 15 future days.

What exactly do you have to predict?

We need to predict sales for each day in the test set for every product family at a specific store.
